			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>
				Growing up, the presence of different cultures was only made apparent once I stepped into grade school. Some days, my mother and her friends would mill around the house, gossiping extravagant stories about their co-workers as the kids and I play. Words of my home country filled the house, yet as soon as I was dropped off at school, nothing familiar reached my ears. I recall feeling immensely frustrated when my first grade teacher asked if anyone wanted brownies. However, confused by the situation, I questioned why other kids got them and I didn’t.
			</p>
			<p>
				Gradually, I became aware and understood the roles of my home language and this foreign language called English. Going through school, new letters incessantly looped my thoughts as images became associated with specific sounds. Soon these letters conjugated to become words that formed sentences. It wasn’t until 8th grade, when grades got a little more serious, that I noticed I had to improve my English in order to keep up. I remember learning the formalities of speech when Socratic seminars were introduced, enforcing the need to quote evidence for ideas. That day, I scrambled to pull some evidence yet failed to do so, resulting in a low grade.
			</p>
			<p>
				An overwhelming pressure was put on me as my parents expected me to help with all of their financial forms and company calls. Though I wanted to help, this was incredibly difficult as I was still learning English. At the start of high-school, I reached out to teachers, asking for assistance and slowly progressing my grammar and vocabulary to an advanced level. Reading and writing essays for over 4 years with the intent to get better every time has put me in the highest level English course offered at my school. Additionally, after overcoming this language barrier, I am easily able to help my family with any form or phone call and participate fully in each Socratic, asking questions and answering insightfully with evidence. My different background has helped me build an appreciation for English as it is something I deliberately learned.

					My mind has always been set to take on the challenge, no matter the outcome.
