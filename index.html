			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>
				Hi I'm Allen Zhai and I'm currently attending Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, majoring in computer science. I'm expected to graduate in 2021, but am right now seeking all new possible ways to learn and struggle through code. There's nothing more satisfying to me then finally understanding or finishing a project.   
			</p>
			<p>
				Computer Science has always been with me ever since I could remember. In some ways, I didn't even realize it was growing on me as I sat at the computer for hours and hours engaging in flash games, watching youtube tutorials, and slowly discovering unaswered questions. Particularly, I questioned how everything I was enjoying was made, whether that be websites, games, or the actual computer iteself. I wanted answers and decided to learn more through a formal education after highschool.
			</p>
			<p>
				In my free time, I love playing ultimate frisbee, Fortnite, and Rocket League. If you cant find me doing any of those things or programing, you can probably find me at a local KBBQ restaurant.

			<p>
				Growing up, the presence of different cultures was only made apparent once I stepped into grade school. Some days, my mother and her friends would mill around the house, gossiping extravagant stories about their co-workers as the kids and I play. Words of my home country filled the house, yet as soon as I was dropped off at school, nothing familiar reached my ears. I recall feeling immensely frustrated when my first grade teacher asked if anyone wanted brownies. However, confused by the situation, I questioned why other kids got them and I didn’t.
			</p>
			<p>
				Gradually, I became aware and understood the roles of my home language and this foreign language called English. Going through school, new letters incessantly looped my thoughts as images became associated with specific sounds. Soon these letters conjugated to become words that formed sentences. It wasn’t until 8th grade, when grades got a little more serious, that I noticed I had to improve my English in order to keep up. I remember learning the formalities of speech when Socratic seminars were introduced, enforcing the need to quote evidence for ideas. That day, I scrambled to pull some evidence yet failed to do so, resulting in a low grade.
